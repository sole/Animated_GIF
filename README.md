Animated_GIF
============

#### Javascript library for creating animated GIFs ####

### How to use it? ###

```javascript
var imgs = document.querySelectorAll('img');

// change workerPath to point to where Animated_GIF.worker.js is
var ag = new Animated_GIF({ workerPath: 'dist/Animated_GIF.worker.js' }); 
ag.setSize(320, 240);

for(var i = 0; i < imgs.length; i++) {
    ag.addFrame(imgs[i]);
}

var animatedImage = document.createElement('img');

// This is asynchronous, rendered with WebWorkers
ag.getBase64GIF(function(image) {
    animatedImage.src = image;
    document.body.appendChild(animatedImage);
});

```

You can also use minified versions in `dist/`.
